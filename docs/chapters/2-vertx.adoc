== Eclipse Vert.x

We will attempt to explain Vert.x in just a few lines. Remember we said in the previous section that Vert.x is _"a toolkit for building
reactive applications on the JVM"_.

=== Vert.x in 10 minutes

There are a three important points in this description: **toolkit**, **reactive** and **on the JVM**.

Firstly, Vert.x is a **toolkit**. This means that Vert.x is neither an application server, a container, nor a framework.
Vert.x is a plain old `jar` file, so a Vert.x application is an application that uses this `jar`
 file. Vert.x does not define a packaging model, all Vert.x _components_ are plain _boring_
 `jar` files. How does this impact you and your application? Let's imagine you are using a build tool such as
 Maven or Gradle. To make your application a Vert.x application just add the `vertx-core` dependency. Wanna use another
 Vert.x component, just add it as a dependency. It's simple, burden-less. Starting the application is a simple class
 with the `public static void main(String[] args)` entry point. There is no specific IDE or plugin to install to start using Vert.x.

Therefore, to use the awesomeness provided by Vert.x, you just need to use it in your code. Be patient, how to do this will be
covered later.

Secondly, Vert.x is **reactive**. It is specifically made to build reactive
applications, or more appropriately, **systems**. Reactive systems footnote:[Reactive systems and reactive programming are two
different _things_. Reactive programming is a development model observing and manipulating data streams, while
reactive systems are systems that react to requests, failures, load peaks and interact using async messages.] have
been defined in the  http://reactivemanifesto.org[Reactive Manifesto]. While it's not a long document to read, we will further reduce it to these 4 bullet points:

* Responsive: a reactive system needs to handle requests in a _reasonable_ time (I'll let you define _reasonable_).
* Resilient: a reactive system must stay responsive in the face of _failures_ (crash, timeout, `500` errors...), so
it must be _designed for failures_ and deal with them appropriately.
* Elastic: a reactive system must stay responsive under various loads. As a consequence, it must scale up and down, and
be able to handle the load with minimal resources.
* Message driven: components from a reactive system interact using **asynchronous message-passing**.

To help accomplish this, Vert.x is event-driven and non-blocking. Events are delivered in an
_event loop_ that **must never be blocked**.

image::event-loop.png[Vert.x Event Loop (simplified view),600]


Let's explain why. Unlike traditional, let's say "enterprise", systems,
Vert.x uses a very small number of threads. Some of these threads are _event loops_ which are responsible for
dispatching the events in `Handlers`. If you block this thread, the events won't be delivered anymore.

image::blocked-event-loop.png[Blocked Event Loop,600]

This execution model impacts how you write your code, instead of the _traditional_ model of blocking code, your code is
going to be asynchronous footnote:[Asynchronous: the caller does not wait for a returned response, but passes
 a _callback_ which is executed when the result has been computed] and non-blocking footnote:[Non-blocking: the code
  must not block the executing thread - so it must avoid blocking IO, long processing time etc.].

As an example, if we wanted to retrieve a resource from a URL, we would do something like this:

[source, java]
----
URL site = new URL("http://vertx.io/");
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(site.openStream()));

String inputLine;
while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
  System.out.println(inputLine);
}
in.close();
----

But with Vert.x we are more likely to do:

[source, java]
-----
vertx.createHttpClient().getNow(80, "vertx.io", "", response -> {
  response.bodyHandler(System.out::println);
});
-----

The main differences between these 2 code samples are:

* The first one is synchronous and potentially blocking : the instructions are executed in _order_, and may block the thread
for a long time (because the web site may be slow or whatever).
* The Vert.x one is asynchronous and non-blocking: the thread (event loop) is released while the connection with the
HTTP server is established and is free to do something else. When the response has been received, the **same** event loop
 calls the _callback_. Most of the Vert.x components are single-threaded (accessed only by a single thread), so no
 concurrency burden anymore. By the way, with Vert.x, even the DNS resolution is asynchronous and non-blocking (while
 Java DNS resolution is blocking).

Finally, Vert.x applications run _"on the JVM"_,
the Java Virtual Machine (8+). This means Vert.x
applications can be developed using any language that runs on the JVM. Including Java (of course), Groovy, Ceylon, Ruby, JavaScript, Kotlin and Scala.
We can even mix and match any combination of all these languages. The polyglot nature of a Vert.x application allows you use the most appropriate language for the task.

Vert.x lets you implement distributed applications either by using the built-in TCP and HTTP server and client, or
by using the Vert.x event bus, a lightweight mechanism to send and receive messages. With the event bus, you send
messages to `addresses`. It supports three modes of distributions:

1. _point to point_: the message is sent to a single _consumer_ listening on the address
2. _publish / subscribe_: the message is received by all the _consumers_ listening on the address
3. _request / reply_: the message is sent to a single _consumer_ and lets it _reply_ to the message by sending another
_message_ to the initial sender

Wow!, that's a lot of information to process ... However, you might still want to ask: **What kind of applications can I use Vert.x for? ** We say, Vert.x is
incredibly flexible - whether it's simple network utilities, sophisticated modern web applications, HTTP/REST
microservices, high volume event processing, or a full blown backend message-bus application, Vert.x is a great fit.
It's fast and does not constraint you. Last but not least, Vert.x provides appropriate tools to build reactive systems; systems that are: _responsive, elastic, resilient, and asynchronous_!

It's time to get your (coding) hands dirty. We are going to start with a few examples about Vert.x. These examples are not
related to the application we are going to develop later in this lab but are just there to let you start playing
with Vert.x.

=== Exercise 1 - Vert.x applications are Java applications

In this first exercise, let's start from the very beginning:

1. Create an instance of Vert.x
2. Start an HTTP server sending greetings

Open the `vertx-exercises/src/main/java/io/vertx/workshop/exercise/Exercise1.java` file. Notice that this exercise is just
 a `main` method.

Follow the instruction located in the class. Use your IDE to run the application (by running the `main` method). If
your code is right, you should see a "Hello" message when you open your browser on http://localhost:8080.

NOTE: Don't forget to stop the application between runs.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
    // 1 - Create the Vert.x instance using Vertx.vertx (use io.vertx.core.Vertx)
    Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();

    // 2 - Create a HTTP server using the `createHttpServer` method. Set a request handler doing:
    // `req.response().end("hello")`
    // Call the listen method with `8080` as parameter.

    vertx.createHttpServer()
        .requestHandler(req -> req.response().end("hello"))
        .listen(8080);
----
****

=== Exercise 2 - Using verticles

While using a main method is nice and simple, it does not necessarily scale. When your code base grows, you need a
better way to structure your code. For this, Vert.x provides _verticles_ - a simple agent-like model. Verticles are
single-threaded classes interacting using asynchronous messages.

Open the `vertx-exercises/src/main/java/io/vertx/workshop/exercise/Exercise2.java` file. In the `main` method, deploy the
`Exercise2Verticle`. Then, implement the missing functionnality in the verticle class (`Exercise2Verticle.java`).

Run and check the result as in the previous exercise. Emit the request several time in a row to check that your
verticle is always executed by the same thread.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
    // Exercise2.java
    // --------------

    // 1 - Create the Vert.x instance using Vertx.vertx (use io.vertx.core.Vertx)
    Vertx vertx = Vertx.vertx();

    // 2 - Deploy the `Exercise2Verticle` verticle using: vertx.deployVerticle(className);
    vertx.deployVerticle(Exercise2Verticle.class.getName());

    // -----------------------------------------------------

    // Exercise2Verticle.java
    // ----------------------

    vertx.createHttpServer()
        .requestHandler(req -> req.response().end(Thread.currentThread().getName()))
        .listen(8080);
----
****

=== Exercise 3 - Do not block the event loop

In this exercise, we are going to voluntarily break the golden rule - block the event loop.

In the `Exercise2Verticle` class, call sleep before writing the result into the response.

When running this code and calling the server, you can see that the requests are not served in a timely fashion
anymore. With the thread being blocked, it can't serve the subsequent requests before completing the first one.

Also notice the output in the console, Vert.x detects that the event loop has been blocked and starts yelling ...

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
vertx.createHttpServer()
    .requestHandler(req -> {
        sleep();
        req.response().end(Thread.currentThread().getName());
    })
    .listen(8080);
----
****

You may wonder how you will be able to call blocking code. Don't worry, Vert.x provides several ways to do so. A
construct named `executeBlocking` and a type of verticle named _worker_ are not executed on the event loop.

=== Exercise 4 - Sending and receiving messages

Verticles are a great way to structure your code, but how do verticles interact? They use the event bus to 
send and receive messages. Let's see how it works. Exercise 4 is composed of 2 verticles: a sender and a
receiver. The sender emits a greeting message periodically. The receiver prints this message to the console. As JSON
is a very common format in Vert.x applications, this exercise also introduces the `JsonObject`, a facility to create
 and manipulate JSON structures.

First, open the `vertx-exercises/src/main/java/io/vertx/workshop/exercise/Exercise4SenderVerticle.java` file and follow the instructions to send a
greeting message every 2 seconds. This message is a JSON structure: `{"message":"hello"}`. Do not hesitate to extend
it if you want.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
// Retrieve the event bus
EventBus eventBus = vertx.eventBus();

// Execute the given handler every 2000 ms
vertx.setPeriodic(2000, l -> {
    // Use the eventBus() method to retrieve the event bus and send a "{"message":hello"} JSON message on the
    // "greetings" address.

    // 1 - Create the JSON object using the JsonObject class, and `put` the 'message':'hello' entry
    JsonObject json = new JsonObject().put("message", "hello");

    // 2 - Use the `send` method of the event bus to _send_ the message. Messages sent with the `send` method
    // are received by a single consumer. Messages sent with the `publish` method are received by all
    // registered consumers.
    eventBus.send("greetings", json);
});
----
****

Then, open the `vertx-exercises/src/main/java/io/vertx/workshop/exercise/Exercise4ReceiverVerticle.java` file and follow the instructions to receive
the messages sent by the other verticle. To achieve this, register a `consumer` on the `greetings` address and
implement the `Handler` to process the received messages.

TIP: Use `vertx.eventBus().<JsonObject>consumer(...)` to indicate to the compiler that you expect a JSON message.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
// Retrieve the event bus and register a consumer on the "greetings" address. For each message, print it on
// the console. You can retrieve the message body using `body()`. Use the method `encodePrettily`
// on the retrieved Json body to print it nicely.
vertx.eventBus().<JsonObject>consumer("greetings", msg -> {
    System.out.println(msg.body().encodePrettily());
});
----
****

To launch this exercise, use the `io.vertx.workshop.exercise.Exercise4#main` method. If implemented correctly you
would see the greeting messages printed on the console. Don't forget to stop the application before switching to the
next exercise.

=== Exercise 5 - Request Reply and Composing actions

Let's now mix the HTTP server and the event bus. The first verticle creates an HTTP server, but to respond to the
request, it sends a message to another verticle and _waits_ for a reply. This reply is used as response to the HTTP
request. This introduces the `request-reply` delivery mechanism of the event bus. This exercice is composed of a
_main` class (`io.vertx.workshop.exercise.Exercise5`) and two verticles: `io.vertx.workshop.exercise
.Exercise5HttpVerticle` and `io.vertx.workshop.exercise.Exercise5ProcessorVerticle`.

Let's start with the  `io.vertx.workshop.exercise.Exercise5ProcessorVerticle` class. Follow the instructions to
receive messages from the `greetings` and reply to the received messages.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
EventBus eventBus = vertx.eventBus();

// Register a consumer and call the `reply` method with a JSON object containing the greeting message. ~
// parameter is passed in the incoming message body (a name). For example, if the incoming message is the
// String "vert.x", the reply contains: `{"message" : "hello vert.x"}`.
// Unlike the previous exercise, the incoming message has a `String` body.
eventBus.<String>consumer("greetings", msg -> {
    JsonObject json = new JsonObject().put("message", "hello " + msg.body());
    msg.reply(json);
});
----
****

Then, edit the `vertx-exercises/src/main/java/io/vertx/workshop/exercise/Exercise5HttpVerticle.java` file. In this verticle, we need to create an HTTP
server. The `requestHandler` extracts the query parameter `name` (or use `world` if not set), sends a message on the
event bus, and writes the HTTP response when the reply from the event bus is received.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
vertx.createHttpServer()
    .requestHandler(req -> {

        // 1 - Retrieve the `name` (query) parameter, set it to `world if null`. You can retrieve the
        // parameter using: `req.getParam()`
        String name = req.getParam("name");
        if (name == null) { name = "world"; }

        // 2 - Send a message on the event bus using the `send` method. Pass a reply handler receiving the
        // response. As the expected object is a Json structure, you can use `vertx.eventBus()
        // .<JsonObject>send(...`).
        // In the reply handler, you receive an `AsyncResult`. This structure describes the outcome from an
        // asynchronous operation: a success (and a result) or a failure (and a cause). If it's a failure
        // (check with the `failed` method), write a 500 HTTP response with the cause (`cause.getMessage()`) as
        // payload. On success, write the body into the HTTP response.
        vertx.eventBus().<JsonObject>send("greetings", name, reply -> {
            if (reply.failed()) {
                req.response().setStatusCode(500).end(reply.cause().getMessage());
            } else {
                req.response().end(reply.result().body().encode());
            }
        });
    })
    .listen(8080);
----
****

Launch the exercise using the `Exercise5#main` method. Check the result by opening your browser to
http://localhost:8080 (should display `hello world`) and http://localhost:8080?name=vert.x (should display `hello
vert.x`).

This exercise shows how to compose asynchronous actions and how to use the `AsyncResult` structure. But as you can
imagine, it quicksly ends up with lots of callbacks. Let's move to the next example to show how RX Java can help
in taming the asynchronous coordination.

=== Exercise 6 - Use RX Java 2

This exercise is a rewrite of the previous one using RX Java 2. RX Java is an implementation of the _reactive
programming_ principles for Java. With this development model, we manipulate _streams_ (called `Flowable`,
`Observable`, `Maybe`, `Single` or `Completable` depending on the number of items and their characteristics). RX Java
 provides a lots of operators to compose _streams_ together and so write asynchronous orchestration easily. This
 exercise is a very basic introduction to RX Java. We will cover the different constructs more deeply later in the
 workshop.

Open the `vertx-exercises/src/main/java/io/vertx/workshop/exercise/Exercise6HttpVerticle.java` file and follow the instructions. Notice the `import`
statements containing the `reactivex` package. This package contains the _RX-ified_ Vert.x API.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
 vertx.createHttpServer()
    .requestHandler(req -> {
        String name = req.getParam("name");
        if (name == null) {
            name = "world";
        }

        // Send a message on the event bus using the `send` method. Pass a reply handler receiving the
        // response. As the expected object is a Json structure, you can use `vertx.eventBus()
        // .<JsonObject>send(...`).
        // Unlike in the previous exercise, we use the `rxSend` method to retrieve a `Single` stream. We then
        // _map_ the result to extract the Json structure (encoded as String).
        // In RX, we must `subscribe` to the stream to trigger the processing. Without this nothing happens. There
        // are several `subscribe` methods, but here we recommend the `BiConsumer` format `(res, err) -> ...`
        // If it's a failure (err != null), write a 500 HTTP response with the cause (`err.getMessage()`) as
        // the payload. On success, write the body (`res`) into the HTTP response.

        vertx.eventBus().<JsonObject>rxSend("greetings", name)
            .map(message -> message.body().encode())
            .subscribe((res, err) -> {
                if (err != null) {
                    req.response().setStatusCode(500).end(err.getMessage());
                } else {
                    req.response().end(res);
                }
            });
    })
    .listen(8080);
----
****

 
Launch the exercise using the `Exercise6#main` method. Check the result by opening your browser to
http://localhost:8080 (should display `hello world`) and http://localhost:8080?name=vert.x (should display `hello
vert.x`).

=== Let's move on

By now, you should have a better understanding of Vert.x and how to use it. But that's just the beginning. Serious
things are coming ...
